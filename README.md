# Weather Forecast
Weather forecast application using OpenWeather's API.
The UI is designed for mobile and it consists of current weather status for selected city and forecast for the next 5 days with high/low temperature for the day.
There is also a light/dark mode toggle at the upper left corner.

You can check out the functionality at [https://nc5324.github.io/weather](https://nc5324.github.io/weather "Weather forecast application")
A free-tier API key from OpenWeather is required to access the functionality. You can get one by registering [here](https://https://openweathermap.org/api "OpenWeather's Website")
